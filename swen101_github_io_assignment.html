	<p>I grew up in Henrietta, NY so RIT has always been 10 minutes away.<br>
		I went Rush-Henrietta Senior High School, and I was a member of Women's Empowerment Club
		and INTERACT Club. I like anime, playing video games, and soccer.<br>

	<p>My favorite food is a cheeseburger (with a side of fries)</p>
